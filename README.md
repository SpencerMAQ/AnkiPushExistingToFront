# AnkiPushExistingToFront

An Anki add-on that reschedules (due=0) cards that match CSV lines.
I wrote this add-on as an exercise and because I couldn't find any plugin with this functionality in mind. 
My intention is to use this plugin to push existing cards from my deck (which contains more than 20k cards) based on a newline-separated
list of vocabs I've mined from different sources.
